# Recipe-Tracking-App
Recipe-Tracking App Project


CRUD app that allows the user to log and store information specific to cooking recipes.

Page displays the current list of recipes and a form to input new recipes. Inputs include the name of the dish, the type of cuisine, a url input that allows the user to include a photo of the dish, the ingredients, and the preparation instructions.

This application was the result of an assessment to practice input forms in Javascript.
